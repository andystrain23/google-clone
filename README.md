# google-clone

## A clone of the Google search page for a non logged in user.

Part of The Odin Project - the goal is to recreate the Google homepage yourself using the knowledge learned so far.

For reference, [this is how Google looked at the time of the project.](https://imgur.com/iTPNdzb)

There are obvious differences like the lack of a carbon neutral icon on the footer link, spacings are off for most of the links and the applications button is offset. These are small things to fix but can be fiddly and I feel it would be more beneficial to continue with other projects or learning that fix these small issues.
