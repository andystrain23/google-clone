# google-clone

## A clone of the Google search page for a non logged in user.

Part of The Odin Project - the goal is to recreate the Google homepage yourself using the knowledge learned so far.

For reference, [this is how Google looked at the time of the project.](https://imgur.com/iTPNdzb)

I am pretty proud of how close I got it to look. There are obvious differences like the lack of a carbon neutral icon on the footer link, spacings are off for most of the links and the applications button is offset.

Hopefully, however, this standard is close enough for someone to think "huh that's google" rather than "huh that's a bad recreation of google".

I am looking forward to continuing the course.
